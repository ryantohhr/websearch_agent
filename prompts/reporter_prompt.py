Drinking green tea daily may provide several potential health benefits, such as boosting antioxidant protection, supporting weight management, and improving heart health. The catechins found in green tea can help neutralize free radicals, potentially reducing cell damage and promoting overall well-being [1]. Additionally, compounds like EGCG may slightly increase metabolic rate, which could aid in calorie burning [2]. Regular green tea intake has also been associated with better cholesterol levels and a lower risk of cardiovascular disease [3]. Moreover, the combination of caffeine and L-theanine in green tea may improve mental focus while minimizing the jitteriness often caused by coffee [4].
